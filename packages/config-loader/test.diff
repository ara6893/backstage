+  Duration:
+    type: object
+    description: >-
+      A Duration object represents a period of time, like "2 months" or "1 day,
+      1 hour". Conceptually, it is just a map of units to their quantities,
+      accompanied by some additional configuration and methods for creating,
+      parsing, interrogating, transforming, and formatting them. They can be
+      used on their own or in conjunction with other Luxon types; for example,
+      you can use  {@link  DateTime.plus  }  to add a Duration object to a
+      DateTime, producing another DateTime.
+
+
+      Here is a brief overview of commonly used methods and getters in Duration:
+
+
+      * **Creation** To create a Duration, use  {@link  Duration.fromMillis } ,  {@link  Duration.fromObject } , or  {@link  Duration.fromISO } .
+
+      * **Unit values** See the  {@link  Duration#years  } ,  {@link  Duration.months } ,  {@link  Duration#weeks  } ,  {@link  Duration#days  } ,  {@link  Duration#hours  } ,  {@link  Duration#minutes  } ,
+
+      *  {@link  Duration#seconds  } ,  {@link  Duration#milliseconds  }  accessors.
+
+      * **Configuration** See   {@link  Duration#locale  }  and  {@link  Duration#numberingSystem  }  accessors.
+
+      * **Transformation** To create new Durations out of old ones use  {@link  Duration#plus  } ,  {@link  Duration#minus  } ,  {@link  Duration#normalize  } ,  {@link  Duration#set  } ,  {@link  Duration#reconfigure  } ,
+
+      *  {@link  Duration#shiftTo  } , and  {@link  Duration#negate  } .
+
+      * **Output** To convert the Duration into other representations, see  {@link  Duration#as  } ,  {@link  Duration#toISO  } ,  {@link  Duration#toFormat  } , and  {@link  Duration#toJSON  } 
+
+
+      There's are more methods documented below. In addition, for more information on subtler topics like internationalization and validity, see the external documentation.
